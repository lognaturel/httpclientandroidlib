# httpclientandroid

This project is __*actively maintained*__

This is a script to change the package name of stock apache http client libraries so that newer libraries can 
be used on Android (otherwise, each Android OS release specifies its own version of these libraries).

The resulting httpclientandroidlib.jar is used by 1.x and 2.0 Android tools
